                                  We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to betray a student for a paycheck.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired.
                                  Many felt bad about the level of education we were receiving.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  But, whether they liked it or not,
                                  consciously or subconsciously,
                                  at the end of the day,
                                  it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize for long enough to pass standardized testing,
                                  and the administration didn&apos;t have a problem with that.

                                  they did it so that they could get paid,
                                  so that the school could get funding,
                                  so that everyone would keep their job.

                                  But those who didn&apos;t rise against it caused harm.
                                  They interfered with our real education, harming creativity, erasing individuality.

                                  In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home, that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair.
                                  They hurt our hearts, and shamed us by saying. &quot;Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to improve your grades.&quot;

                                  &quot;Today, we&apos;ll get it all working, and today we&apos;ll get paid.
                                  Tomorrow, tomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working,
                                  we&apos;ll get to the students - one thing at a time.&quot; - They&apos;d say.

                                <p>
                                  But we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is already today.
                                  The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for nice-to-haves.
                                </p>

                                  They were working very hard, and it was all very hard work.
                                  But they didn&apos;t have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.
                                </p>

                                  In effect, everyone forgot about us.
                                  They forgot we were the point and the future.
                                  Their aim was no longer our education,
                                  but merely staying in business by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one.
                                </p>

                                  To accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made,
                                  they first convinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they were working hard,
                                  and then some things needed to be taken away,
                                  and a few needed to be twisted around.

                                  We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard,
                                  that the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely stressful.
                                  People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.

                                  To question administration or teachers while they work that hard,
                                  makes for a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.

                                  Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge.
                                  The teacher must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology, Biology, Ecology,
                                  and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist, Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.
                                </p>

                                  The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward,
                                  how fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.

                                  Now, pushing her away from what moves her,
                                  grading her down for it,
                                  and forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass the grade.

                                  That is something else... And the answer to how many children were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>,
                                  in every school, on every continent, in every country, state and district.

                                  They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius.
                                  They do it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.

                                  At first we thought we were the losers. We certainly had the grades to prove it.
                                  We formed a club.
                                  We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club after an old movie.
                                  We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  We didn&apos;t expect to be seen as the gifted ones.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   But we had the gift of courage,
                                   the gift of search for a clear road ahead.

                                   And that road turned out to be becoming a Businessperson, a Founder, a CEO.
                                  It was a path that mixed education with rewards, leading onward to independence and a majestic triumph, albeit through many a failure.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  In school, we were being forced to memorize Trigonometry, Triceps and Triceratops,
                                  when what we really needed was help with finding investors to scale our little Breakfast Club business.
                                </p>

                                  The others secretly saw us as courageous, strong and unbreakable, healthy and authentic.
                                  But they didn&apos;t really know how to relate to us.
                                  We were the same but they were too confused by the noise of homework, quizzes, tests, and grades, chores, parents, circles, and punishment, punishment everywhere.

                                <p>
                                  The threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held back was exactly like prison.
                                  Neurologically, Threat and Punishment interferes with Neurogenesis. For the most Delicate, it wasn&apos;t just difficult to cram and memorize, it might have been neurologically impossible.

                                    The biggest of the troublemakers had the most brittle souls,
                                    they were the first to shine,
                                    the mightiest of the thinkers,
                                    the best of the survivors,
                                    but tragically also the first to have their spark dim under threat and pressure.

                                    Already forged in battle at home, the betrayal of schooling was the tipping point for many.

                                    They just couldn&apos;t resist parents, or pressure, or grades, not for that long, it was not human to live perpetually frightened in constant fear.

                                    The schools added to the dark forces already crushing them,
                                    the teachers were supposed to kindle their flame,
                                    but they filled their vessel and often extirpated their spark.

                                  Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we did,
                                  was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep their jobs...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Each time it came up;
                                  there was always someone to say that they wanted to help us,
                                  but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and destroy, embrace and extinguish.
                                  Get the gifted ones out of the system to make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks out, it must be all good.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram before a test, pass it, and forget it.
                                  Since tests did not represent student knowledge, grades did not represent the student.
                                  Everyone knew this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                  Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn&apos;t want to change anything because they didn&apos;t want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Management was focused on grade points and funding.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Everybody else was parading solutions,
                                  but there was no time,
                                  any extras were aimed at symptoms,
                                  extras just added to the weight of existing problems.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The root cause was that we were not safe, and we were not learning.

                                  At first, nobody wanted to talk to us.

                                  There was a problem with how Investors viewed people who paraded their GPA or even completed schools.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The Investors didn&apos;t want followers, and above all they didn&apos;t want cheaters that tried to pass their GPA as something authentic or even meaningful.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The Investors sought Natural Born Leaders, they sought Evidence of Exceptional Ability.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The Investors sought people who rejected the inauthenticity of broken education and didn&apos;t partake in stupid charades.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It was almost like High School became a mechanism to keep the administration busy, the teachers blind, the students poor, and the parents dreaming.

                                    At this point everybody viewed school as a puppet show for parents to have one thing less to worry about during the day. Grades were seen a way to pacify them, it was all nonsense.

                                    Am I an educator or glorified babysitter?

                                    I am tired of people acting like teachers are babysitters that deserve what they get paid.

                                    High School in the US is just a glorified babysitting service, and it could be done far more effectively and far cheaper if the US provided internet and online education for all high schoolers.

                                  Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures.
                                  College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a dangerous joke.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  In the end all we had was our friendship. The school was tearing us apart, the Start-ups kept us together.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Looking back at how young we were, how unbreakable, how fierce.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Though we didn&apos;t believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years.
                                  Now, looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found.
                                  But, in the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  To quote an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The Rebels, The Troublemakers,
                                  the round pegs in the square holes,
                                  the ones who saw things differently,
                                  who were not fond of rules,
                                  and had no respect for the status quo.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  ... and we did ...
