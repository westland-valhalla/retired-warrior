          <p>She said men fight, countries fight.</p>
          <p>But she made that man, sound alien, and distant, and a stranger too.</p>

        <div class="widget text" data-title="The Vision">

          <p> Sam Harris, beautifully once said "Leave all Bad Ideas Behind", I added "and Converge On Wisdom". </p>

          <p> In order to hasten the leaving of bad ideas behind. We must accept the responsibility for our own education. </p>

          <p> As I write this, the year is 2020, and I have quarantined my self for what is now 32 days, as the world is in a state of global pandemic. Reality is such that borders are not realistic. </p>

          <p> They do not ensure economic stability, as the internet teaches us, borders are not necessary. I came to America as Berlin Wall fell, Soviet Union collapsed, going to where I wanted to be, set me free. Free to think, to learn, to explore, to grow up. </p>

          <p> To be denied entry to a nation you feel you belong in, is to be forced to live where you don't belong, where you don't want to be. </p>

          <p> In my old dream I wanted United States to evolve into The United States of The World. </p>

          <p> But let us rid of the borders entirely. So as long as there are borders, there will be vision, where there are divisions there will be war. </p>

        <div class="widget text" data-title="The Future">

          <p>To see the world as one, we have to learn towards the same aim.</p>

          <p>Once Educated, every barrier will fall.</p>

          <p>There will be no politicians running under the banner of Uniting The World, or World Peace.</p>

          <p>It is a rare creature that does not optimize ones own career for profit.</p>

          <p>An honest politician is by definition, weak, easy to attack, hard to see, meek.</p>

          <p>A dishonest politician, is ravenous, angry, harmful, blind, manipulative, and ready to kill..</p>

          <p>Politics, will not unite the world. It will leave it blind, as nations trade eyes, for insignificant glory, meaningless trumps, at the cost of lives of their children who are used as bills. How many bills does one nation have to pay in battle, to win against another.</p>

          <p>A Pandemic is more likely to unite the world, than politics.</p>

          <p>For those of you who enter the area, remember that in a compromise between Good and Evil, the evil feeds, and the good weakens.</p>

          <p>The Peace is reached by learning Good Ideas, together.</p>
          <p>Incomprehensible Standardized Education, may keep us deaf, dumb and blind.</p>
          <p>But self-education, is self correcting.</p>
          <p>The wisest of books reference one another, reinforce their networks of good ideas.</p>
          <p>They critique bad ideas, destroy them.</p>

          <p>Humanity has always asked why.</p>
          <p>Humanity has always asked questions that have clear to see beginnings, and easy to understand endings.</p>
          <p>We have invented tens of thousands of creation stories, many thousands of Gods.</p>
          <p>But truth, and the easy answers we seek, require some scientific knowledge before we can understand them. Nothing hard, nothing uncomfortable. Just a few sweet books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physics_of_Superheroes">The Physics of Superheroes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a></p>

          <p>I cannot express how happy I was to learn from Jared Diamond, that the reason we have not domesticated Zebras is that when they bite us, unlike horses, Zebras tend to not to let go for a goodie long while. And it is hard to argue what a great teacher a Zebra makes.</p>

            <p>Once, jogging at 1AM in Ann Arbor, when listening to A Short History of Nearly Everything one of the first few times, I was jolted awake to discover the F-word. I remember bursting out in a laugh, and that's hard to forget. It takes me back to my lonely magnificent triumps, as well as knowledge in books.</p>

          There was so much unrecognized novelty in the collection that at one point

          <p>We lean that Greta's words are correct "Fairy tales of eternal economic growth" are so beneath us. Ms. Thunberg reminds us what it means to grow up, what it is like to be a grown up.</p>

          <p>You do not need to become a scientist, to help the world grow.</p>

          <p>You just need to come to the point where you can never be bought, where you will never sacrifice your Dignity and Nobility, where you construct your thoughts and ideas based on hard won truths and rational thinking. Based on knowledge inherited from Humanities most beloved modern non-fiction books.</p>

          <p>A hard one truth for example, is that education is necessary, that there is no progress without science, no cure without biology, no leadership without Wisdom.</p>

          <p>Lessons we learned across thousands of years, and most recently alike. Without standing on those shoulders we start at the beginning. Lies, War, Disease, Genocide, Xenophobia.</p>

          <p>With those lessons, we literally begin where all the fun to read Science Popularize audio-books end.</p>

            Education is our only way. There is none other.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know that for some of you this will seem impossible.
            Because a man crushed by poverty has no time for books.
            This is why we must focus on delivering the message of self education to young people,
            give them a chance at understanding before they become encumbered with bills, mortgages, cars and working for their kids.
            Older people will see the change in their children, and they are more likely to give those books a chance too.

            All those crazy cult people, the strange voters that vote for the wrong people, the dumb kids that fight, and the gangs that kill.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their Only problem is being stuck is a very raw deal. And they want to grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            The only way to make a big difference, is to help them prevent their children from ending up like they are.
          </p>

          <p>
            The children have the time, the adults lack.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let us prevent lack of education, by helping children learn on their own, in their own way, from the most sweet and powerful books.
